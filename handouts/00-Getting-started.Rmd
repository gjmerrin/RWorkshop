## R notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Crtl+Shift+Enter* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac). 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert* button on the toolbar, then selecting *R* or by pressing  *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Windows) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+K* (Mac) to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


## What you will learn in this two-part workshop

This is a short workshop that aims to guide you with the best practices in using R for statistical analyses, specifically for psychologists. Hence there are some portions which I will highlight more than the others. Additionally, this workshop will assume you know some basic knowledge in R. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the `tidyverse` collection, which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. In short you will learn:

- reading and writing data using `readr`
- data manipulation with `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `tibble`
- data visualization and `ggplot2` grammar


### This is an example of a plot you will be able to create at the end of this workshop!
``` {r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = class, 
                 size = cyl)) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 4))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between  displacement and highway MPG",
       x = "Displacement",
       y = "Highway Miles per Gallon") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#e69f00", "#56b3e9", "#009e73", "#f0e442", 
                                "#0072b2", "#d55c00", "#cc79a7", "#000000")) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",
                              size = 16,
                              hjust = 0.5),

    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -0.2),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 2),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
    
    panel.background = element_rect(fill ="#ffffff"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#f0f0f0"),
    
    legend.background = element_rect(color = "black", fill = "#EEEEEE"),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    
    strip.background = element_rect(colour = "#f0f0f0", fill = "#f0f0f0"),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
