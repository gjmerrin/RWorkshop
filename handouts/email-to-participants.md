Dear participant,


Thank you for signing up for the R Workshop: Introduction to data wrangling with Tidyverse.  

This is a two-day hands on workshop where you will learn how to visualize, transform, and model data in R.

As I know everyone is busy with work, research, and classes, this workshop is not meant to teach you the basics of R, but to share some best practices in R. Hence if you want to learn more foundational R programming, please check out the pre-workshop notes to get started.

During this workshop, we will be using R with R Studio. Hence you will need a personal laptop that allows you to install both R and R Studio

Download the most recent versions of R and RStudio for the appropriate OS using the links below:

1. [R] (https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. [RStudio] (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. The set of relevant R packages, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running:  

    install.packages(
        c("remotes", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "tidyverse", "kableExtra", "skimr",
        "haven", "readxl", "ggbeeswarm", "ggrepel", "xaringan", "fontawesome","DT")
    )

    remotes::install_github('yihui/xaringan')

In the unlikely event that there are problems with installing R and R Studio, you can use RStudio Cloud, but you'll need a laptop that can access the internet.  

In some cases for Windows users, you may encounter errors while installing some packages as you need Rtools installed. In that case, please install [Rtools here](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/).

If you're a new R user, it's possible that installing R will be challenging. In that case, feel free to count on RStudio Cloud. You can also contact me before the workshop so we can troubleshoot together.

Please also download the RWorkshop repository before the workshop [here](https://github.com/winsonfzyang/RWorkshop) so you have all the materials for the workshop when we begin.
The full workshop materials will be uploaded on 15th June. Before that, you can download the slides and introductory content from the repository.

Last but not least, we will be using Zoom for the Workshop. Here is the meeting link for the workshop:
