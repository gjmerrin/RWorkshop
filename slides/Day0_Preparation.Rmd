# Workhop aims

Introduce the main components of the Tidyverse
- readr (read files)
- dplyr (manipulate data)
- ggplot2 (make awesome graphs)

I have to assume you have a basic knowledge of R

We don't really have time to cover all of the tidyverse (it is a huge universe!)

# Part 0: Basic R programming 

---

# R is a calculator

R can be thought of as a calculator, where you can perform different operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, divisions, and exponentiation. These are just some examples:

.pull-left[
``` {r}
4 + 4       # addition
4 - 4       # subtraction
4 * 4       # multiplication

```
]

.pull-right[
``` {r}
4 / 4       # division
4 ^ 4       # exponentiation
sqrt(4)     # Square root
```

]

---

# Objects in R

As R is an object-based language, you can name any value, or string or set it as a variable. For example, you can set 4 to be called a using `a = 4`, or `a <- 4`. Then when you want to call out 4, you can type `a` in the editor to call out the variable.

.pull-left[

``` {r}
a <- 4              # numerics
a
```

You can also perfom calculations with the objects you have created!

``` {r tidy=TRUE, results='hold'}
a + a # Addition
a - a*2 # Subtraction & Multiplication
```
]

.pull-right[
``` {r}
b <- "Hello world!" # characters
b

```

However, you cannot perform mathematical calculations on characters!

``` {r error=TRUE}
b - b # Gives an error!

```
]

---

# Naming your objects

You can name your objects anything you want (up to your imagination!), but there are a few rules. Names cannot start with number, and they cannot use special symbols such as `^`, `!`, `$`, `@`, `+`, `-`, `/`, or `*`:

``` {r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

GoodNames <- c("a", "Boo", "FOO", "my_variables", ".variables", "mod.1")
BadNames <- c("1a", "!Boo", "$", "^my_variables", "/variables", "*mod.1")

df <- data.frame(GoodNames, BadNames, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

kable(df, format="html")

```

Some best practice of object naming: The object name should be **`consise`**, **`meaningful`**, **`consistent`**, and **`specific`**.


---

# Vectors

Vectors contain **elements of the same type**. The data types can be integer, double, character, logical, complex or raw (we don't go into complex or raw data). Vectors are generally created using the `c()` function.

--

.pull-left[
- integer (numbers without decimals)

```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
v1
```

- double (numbers with decimals)

```{r}
v2 <- c(1.234, 0.632, -0.234, 7/42)
v2
```
]

--

.pull-right[
- character/strings (text)

```{r}
c("Hello", "World", "!", "Are you", "555?")

```

- logical

```{r}
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, F, T) 
# Do not use F or T for logical. It gets confusing

```

]


---

# Vectors with different types of elements

What happens when you have a vector that contains different types of elements? They will coerce into a single type of element

--

.pull-left[
- integers and doubles

```{r, tidy=TRUE, results='hold'}
v1 <- c(1L, 2L, 3L) # putting L after a number makes it an integer
v2 <- c(1, 2.86, 3)
v1
v2
```

``` {r, results='hold'}
typeof(v1) # typeof() determines the type of an object
typeof(v2)

```

]

--

.pull-right[
- characters, logicals and doubles

```{r}
v3 <- c("Hello", TRUE, 555)
v3
typeof(v3)
```

]

---

# Data Frames

While vectors are one-dimensional, a data frame is a table-like data structure that is two-dimensional in nature.

--

Data frames can store multiple types of elements, such as doubles, logicals, and characters

--


```{r }
df <- data.frame(c(-9.1,0.2,3.4,4,5), # Doubles
                 c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), # Logicals
                 c("Var1", "Var2", "Var3", "Var4", "Var5")) # Characters
names(df) <- c("Double", "Logical", "Character") # Use names() to view the column names
df
```

---

# Data Frames

We can check the structure of the data frame using `str()` to check the type of element of each column.

```{r}
str(df) # str() stands for structure
```

We see that R automatically converts the character column into a factor!

---

# Loading and saving data

In any programming language, we must know how to load and save our data. In R, we can load our data with various functions:

.pull-left[
- text files: `read.table()`

- csv files: `read.csv()`
]

.pull-right[
- xlsx files: `read.xlsx()` using the `xlsx ` package

- SPSS data: `read.sav()` using the `haven` package
]

--

## We also must know how to save our data! 


--

I would recommend saving your data in **`.csv`** format as it loads and saves faster. Additionally, whether loading or saving data, we can save it in specific folders using `file.path(yourpath, filename)`. In summary, this is how a saving/loading data looks like in R:

--


```{r}
rootdir <- "D:/Winson/Github/R-Workshop" 
datadir <- file.path(rootdir, "data") # Construct the path to the data directory
csvfile <- "df_example.csv"
file.path(datadir, csvfile) # Gives the full path
```

--

You will then type `write.csv(df, file.path(rootdir, csvfile))` to save the file. Simple, isn't it?
